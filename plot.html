        <p class="mb-2 text-body-secondary" style="font-size: 20px;margin-top: 20px;">On October 28, 2003, 19-year-old Harvard University sophomore Mark Zuckerberg is
            dumped by his girlfriend,
            Erica Albright. Returning to his dorm, Zuckerberg writes an insulting post about Albright on his LiveJournal
            blog. He creates a campus website called Facemash by hacking into college databases to steal photos of
            female students, then allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness. After traffic to the site crashes
            parts of Harvard's computer network, Zuckerberg is given six months of academic probation. However,
            Facemash's popularity attracts the attention of twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their business
            partner Divya Narendra. The trio invites Zuckerberg to work on Harvard Connection, a social network
            exclusive to Harvard students and aimed at dating. Zuckerberg approaches his friend Eduardo Saverin with an
            idea for Thefacebook, a social networking website that would be exclusive to Ivy League students. Saverin
            provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Zuckerberg to build the website, which quickly becomes popular.
            When they learn of Thefacebook, the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed, believing that Zuckerberg
            stole their idea while misleading them by stalling development on the Harvard Connection website. They raise
            their complaint with Harvard President Larry Summers, who is dismissive and sees no value in disciplinary
            action on Thefacebook or Zuckerberg.</p>

        <p class="mb-2 text-body-secondary" style="font-size: 20px;margin-top: 20px;">Saverin and Zuckerberg meet fellow student Christy Lee, who asks them to "Facebook
            me," a phrase that
            impresses them. As Thefacebook grows in popularity, Zuckerberg expands the network to Yale University,
            Columbia University, and Stanford University. Lee arranges for Saverin and Zuckerberg to meet Napster
            co-founder Sean Parker, who presents a "billion-dollar" vision for the company. Zuckerberg is impressed, but
            Saverin dismisses him as paranoid and delusional. Parker also suggests renaming the site to Facebook. Later,
            Zuckerberg relocates the company to Palo Alto on Parker's advice; Saverin remains in New York to work on
            business development. Parker later moves into the house that Zuckerberg is using as a base of operations and
            becomes more involved with the company, much to Saverin's annoyance</p>

        <p class="mb-2 text-body-secondary" style="font-size: 20px;margin-top: 20px;">While competing in the 2004 Henley Royal Regatta for Harvard against the Hollandia
            Roeiclub, the Winklevoss
            twins discover that Facebook has expanded to Europe with Oxford, Cambridge and LSE, and decide to sue the
            company for intellectual property theft. Meanwhile, Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for
            Facebook and freezes the company's bank account in the resulting dispute. He relents when Zuckerberg reveals
            that they have secured $500,000 from angel investor Peter Thiel. Saverin becomes enraged when he discovers
            that the new investment deal allows his share of Facebook to be diluted from 34% to 0.03% while maintaining
            the ownership percentage of all other parties. He confronts Zuckerberg and Parker, and Saverin vows to sue
            Zuckerberg before being ejected from the building. Saverin's name is removed from the masthead as co-founder
            and CFO. Later, Parker is apprehended for cocaine possession at a party celebrating 1 million users. He
            attempts to blame Saverin, so Zuckerberg cuts ties with him, telling him to go home.</p>

        <p class="mb-2 text-body-secondary" style="font-size: 20px;margin-top: 20px;">In separate depositions, the Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their
            idea, while Saverin claims
            his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. Marylin Delpy, a junior
            lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin since the sordid details of
            Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's callous attitude will make him unsympathetic to a jury. Alone,
            Zuckerberg sends a Facebook friend request to Albright and repeatedly refreshes the page.</p>
